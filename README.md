### How to use this Project

#### Repo Branch Structure

Used with care, an approval process ensures curriculum development and class content are collaborative efforts. This will require strong communication and that concerns such as time to approval and the appropriate amount of oversight are considered.

1. *Master*: Finalized, reviewed, and approved student-facing content
2. *Staging*: Finalized, reviewed, and approved but not yet live content
3. *Approved*: DC, IKC, or Primary Instructor reviewed and approved content
4. *Review*: Content requiring review by DC, IKC, or Primary Instructor
5. *Proposed*: New content open to colleague feedback and review
6. *Experimental*: Unpolished sandbox content not meant for review
