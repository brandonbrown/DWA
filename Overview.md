# Class Overview
Class Description, Motivations, and Outlook

### Course Description

> In the Web Application Integration course, all of the elements of web development come together with an emphasis on the integration of complex, interactive solutions being prepared for deployment. Students will complete the process of integrating and optimizing a web-based solution that is compatible with various platforms and targeted devices. This course teaches skills required to produce web solutions within modern production environments.

### Instructor's Description

> WAI has been designed to leverage project creation, management, and fulfillment techniques relevant to current industry momentum. Students are challenged to pitch, design, and develop a project to the standards of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Student's are responsible for cross-device and multi-platform delivery, API development and utilization, and held to strict workflow standards. The students are responsible for the decision and defense of languages, environments, and other project-critical technology choices.

### Class Motivations

> To best position our graduates, this class is primarily motivated to reinforce Systems Design through challenges and guidance from their instructor.

### Class Outlook

> WAI has been successfully running as a self-directed project class for just under two years. This makes WAI a natural place to test Final Project concepts and the effects on the student experience. This iteration has the class taking the front-runner position in regards to Final Project, however in the near future WAI will be the last-chance for students to decide their project's path and have loftier project expectations as students come into the class overall better prepared.
