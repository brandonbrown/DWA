## Prototype

### High-fidelity Desktop and Mobile Comps

You will utilize a Design Sprint this first week to help reinforce your design and feature set assumptions. The Design Sprint is a 5 day process championed by Google and other large companies for its speed and time to interaction with real customers.

The artifacts of this process will be responses to a set of user tests, which will be responses to high-fidelity designs used in an image based prototype. Your prototypes can be built with a tool such as Adobe XD, InVision, Marvel, or another similar software solution.

### User Tests

The User Tests from the design sprint will create informational artifacts for you to reinforce assumptions and fall back to when stuck at a decision point. The user tests will be performed in person with people fitting your product's demographic. Tests will be formalized into professional documentation ready for distribution to team members and product stake holders.
