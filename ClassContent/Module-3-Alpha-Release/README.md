# DWA Module 3: Alpha Release

Development and refinement of the Capstone Project's feature set will continue. Additional requirements for deployment to live environments will be introduced for the Alpha Release.

Students need to create the Staging and Live Server Environments for their project. Depending on the needs of their tech stack this could include multiple components to be installed and configured. Students will be tasked with the research and implementation of installing their required tech stack components.

At the end of this milestone, the student's codebase should be running on two separate instances, one representing the live / master branch of the code base, and another representing the staging / proposed release. Documentation should be created to provide a step-by-step checklist to follow when deploying to either environment.

> Milestone Deliverables:
>  * [ ] Staging & Live Server Environments Established
>  * [ ] Alpha Release of Codebase
>  * [ ] Velocity Check
