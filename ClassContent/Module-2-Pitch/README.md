# DWA Module 2: Pivot

The refinement of the project spec will be the primary concern for this milestone. At this time Students have conceived of an idea, roughly spec'd it, built an MVP, and have received significant critical feedback. Now is the time to utilize that feedback to refine the project spec and build out the proper project plan.

This plan will be the final plan of attack for completion and release of the Capstone Application. Students will be seeking final approval of this spec.
