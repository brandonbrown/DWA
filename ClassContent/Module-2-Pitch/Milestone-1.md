## Milestone 1: Pitch

Just as every project will require its own specialized set of technical specifications, there is no single format to best communicate the potential of a new project. Some projects may require the show of a formal, in-person event with an all-encompassing slide deck and handouts for each attendee, while others need a napkin and a handshake. For your project, its up to you to decide how you will share your concept with an audience who can provide critical and project shaping critique.

Do not set out seeking pats-on-the-back and exuberant yes's from each person you share your concept with. Your pitch should be targeted to win your biggest critics over. Being prepared, mindful of your audience, and open to suggestions will get you to the meat of the best feedback.

This week you will be creating a concept for your project, researching the potential of this concept, communicating your concept to those who can offer effective feedback, as well as planning how to effectively deliver a Minimum Viable Product by month's end.

### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. RFP Response

On Day One of this class you will receive a prompt to conceive and execute on a new application concept. A response to this prompt is due by Tuesday night in the form of a PDF document submitted to this activity. This document summarizes your concept at a high-level. Include a small but well thought out description of the application, a few major features, expected technology stack, and a small summary of why you think this application is the best use of your time. This document does not lock you in to features or technology choices.

#### 2. Project Specifications Draft

Over the course of the first two weeks of class, you'll be expected to create, maintain, and expand on a Project Specifications document. This will describe your project in detail. This will include all major sections of the RFP, plus any other items you require to fully detail your project. A draft of this document is expected by this milestone's completion. This document may be modified after the Discovery Phase through change requests.

#### 3. Concept Research

You will be expected to show active and thorough research into your concept application(s). This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 5. Concept Prototype

You will utilize a Design Sprint this first week. To move away from assumptions about your design and feature sets, you'll perform your own research with user tests and interviews to build a basis of data to better inform your decisions. The Design Sprint is a 5 day process championed by Google and other large companies for its speed and time to interaction with real customers.

The deliverables of this process will be documented feedback to a set of user tests, which will be responses to high-fidelity designs used in an image based prototype system. Your prototypes can be built with a tool such as Adobe XD, InVision, Marvel, Figma, or another similar software solution.

#### 6. User Tests and Interviews

The User Tests from the design sprint will create informational artifacts for you to reinforce assumptions and fall back to when stuck at a critical decision point. The user tests will be performed in person with people fitting your product's demographic. Tests will be formalized into professional documentation ready for distribution to team members, instructors, and other collaborators.

#### 7. The Pitch

All of the work you'll be performing during this sprint will culminate into a pitch video, shared will all faculty of the Web Design and Development Degree. This video will be shared Friday afternoon, requiring you to have it completed by Thursday evening. In about 5 to 7 minutes, to the best of your abilities describe the following:

1. Introduction: Who you are and your application's elevator pitch.
2. The problem you see in the current market.
3. How your application solves this problem.
4. Market Understanding (Competition, target audience, feature list, etc.)
5. Current design, assumptions, and research findings
6. How you expect to build your application
7. Short summary of important facts

Remember, this is to introduce the concept to a wide network of professionals. Your goal is to receive meaningful feedback. If a comment is made that makes you doubt the entire concept, you're on the right track!

#### 8. Stand Ups

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will include your follow up steps for research, rapid prototyping, documentation creation, and project management information such as links to a GitHub repo and a Trello board. Your second submission should reflect on your pitch, feedback you've received, and how overall progress of this Discovery phase is proceeding.
