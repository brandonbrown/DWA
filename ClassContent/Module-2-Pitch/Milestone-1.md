## Milestone 1: Pitch

Just as every project will require its own specialized set of technical specifications, there is no single format to best communicate the potential of a new project. Some projects may require the show of a formal, in-person event with an all-encompassing slide deck and handouts for each attendee, while others need a napkin and a handshake. For your project, its up to you to decide how you will share your concept with an audience who can provide critical and project shaping critique.

Do not set out seeking pats-on-the-back and exuberant yes's from each person you share your concept with. Your pitch should be targeted to win your biggest critics over. Being prepared, mindful of your audience, and open to suggestions will get you to the meat of the best feedback.

This week you will be creating a concept for your project, researching the potential of this concept, communicating your concept to those who can offer effective feedback, as well as planning how to effectively deliver a Minimum Viable Product by month's end.

### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. RFP Response
#### 2. Project Specifications Draft
#### 3. Concept Research
#### 5. Concept Prototype

You will utilize a Design Sprint this first week to help reinforce your design and feature set assumptions. The Design Sprint is a 5 day process championed by Google and other large companies for its speed and time to interaction with real customers.

The artifacts of this process will be responses to a set of user tests, which will be responses to high-fidelity designs used in an image based prototype. Your prototypes can be built with a tool such as Adobe XD, InVision, Marvel, or another similar software solution.

#### 6. User Tests and Interviews

The User Tests from the design sprint will create informational artifacts for you to reinforce assumptions and fall back to when stuck at a decision point. The user tests will be performed in person with people fitting your product's demographic. Tests will be formalized into professional documentation ready for distribution to team members and product stake holders.
