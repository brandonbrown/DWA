Re: Final Project**

*Web Application Integrations would like you to create a new product:*

>You have been selected as a student to respond to this request and would like to ask you to prepare a proposal to accomplish the task that includes timeline, technical requirements, and deliverables. The following RFP includes a background of Final Project and describes the purpose of your Final Project, its desired functionality, and specific requests relating to the proposal. We understand that details may be subject to change upon student recommendation and research.

### Project Overview
The goal of your Final Project is to demonstrate the capabilities you've cultivated, to display your work in its best form, and to build something with a personal drive behind it. Work done within this project should highlight the areas you would like focus your career within. This includes the research, design, development, marketing, and deployment of a live working application.

### Background
Final Project in the past has incubated various types of projects and working environments. Projects have ranged from Barn Management to Social Music Concert solutions to Restaurant Booking Systems. The Final Project instructors help drive student work forward with their expertise, passion, and love of technological development. The instructors involved around Final Project bring a wide-spread history of different talents and professional roles to bring together a well rounded support system for your projects.

### Project Goals
Explain what you plan to accomplish or what outcome you have in mind. What are the three most important things that, if done well, you’ll consider the project a success? Do you know of any quantitative metrics that will help, such as  sales, subscribers, or audience growth?

Whom do you plan to serve with the application? Which constituencies most rely on a successful application, in order of importance? Sometimes, the audience you’re intending to reach or serve with the application is not the same as your wider market. For example, a non-profit site might need mainly to demonstrate its programs’ efficacy to donors and supporters, not necessarily serve its beneficiaries. Similarly, a startup may be more focused on attracting investors than customers and an established business may only really care about their largest 5% of clients.

### Scope of Work
Here’s where you want to provide more detail about the project. To the extent you can, describe every major feature of and its importance to the project's success. For example, with an application project, you may be responsible for:

•	Project management
•	Content strategy
•	Copywriting
•	Illustration
•	Information design
•	Visual design
•	Search engine optimization
•	Front-end coding
•	Back-end coding
•	Custom software or app development
•	Mobile device optimization
•	Testing & quality assurance
•	Timeline for Completion
•	Final Deliverables

For a task like Information Design, maybe the deliverables are a site map and wireframes. For Visual Design, it may be a prototype, mood board, or high-fidelity compositions. Something like Project management won't really have a deliverable, however it should be clearly outlined which tools, processes, and communication expectations you'll be holding yourself to. Aim to be explicit about what you will deliver, and remember to reach out for critique and feedback to find your blindspots.

### Information Architecture
As much as the visual design impacts visitors' perception of your company is the information design: how well thought out are your major site sections and navigation schema? If you already have a good idea how you'd like to organize it, include that here. (If not, that's OK too -- that'll be one of the many things you'll do during the sprint and discovery phase with your instructors.)

### Project Timeline
How will you fit your project into the time allotted over the next two or three months? Discuss timeline expectations with all of your final instructors.

### Technical Requirements
This is where detail really matters. To the smallest detail, outline your application's feature set. This section will see the most revisions as you research and obtain feedback from your peers.

### E-commerce
Do you expect to sell products or charge credit cards? A non-profit may only want to accept simple (or recurring) donations but retail merchants require shopping carts, user accounts, inventory control, shipping calculators, and security.

### Content Management Software
Do you require something specific, such as Drupal or Wordpress? Are you willing to build your own?

### Programming Language
What languages, frameworks, and libraries will the project require? How will this impact your development and production environments?

### Web Host
What does your project require in a web host, and what are the best options?

### Browser Support
Which browsers, operating systems, and devices do you plan to support? How did you come to this decision?

### Integrations
Does your application depend on 3rd party services for things like email newsletters, marketing automation, CRM / contact management, inventory control, intranet, accounting / Quickbooks, or inventory management? If so, be sure to include the ones for which synching / integration with the website is essential and describe how you expect it to work. For example, when someone subscribes to a newsletter, the contact should be added automatically to Highrise or Salesforce. If someone purchases a product and opts in, they should be added to our Mailchimp database, etc.

### User Accounts
Do you require membership management in your application?

### Accessibility
Government & public sites often require Section 508 compliance. How do you plan to handle accessibility?

### Mobile Responsive Design
Do you require a separate mobile-optimized version of the application, or will you build one application for all devices? A layout optimized for small screens and tablets can make a big difference in the delight and satisfaction of site visitors.

### More Information
Anything else unique to your project?  Ultimately, how much detailed information do you have about the application?
