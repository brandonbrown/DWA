Your Course Director for the month will be: Brandon Brown

I look forward to working with you this month. Please contact me with questions if you need help with any of the material. It is my pleasure to have this opportunity to help you, and it will be exciting to see your work take shape! All messages will be responded to within 24 - 48 hours. If you do not receive a response by then, please follow up, as it's possible your message may have been missed or not delivered. To be sure, I suggest a follow-up by another method if no response is ever received.

Note: Attachments in e-mail are discouraged as they may get held up in quarantine. The preferred way to share information is via links you provide to a repository or a supplemental location. Individual appointments can be requested. In general, email and appointment requests will be responded to in a 24 - 48 hour time period during normal business days.
