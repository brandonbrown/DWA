# Class Information

Take some time to read the Class Information below. You will be responsible for policies and information found within. The content in this and the Professionalism activity will be required knowledge for the Class Information Quiz.

# Deployment of Web Applications Overview

In this course you will complete a custom project defined by you with various defined requirements. This project will showcase your ability to conceive of a project to solve a problem for an audience. 

## Rubric

Each assignment will have a [Shared Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WN6gM6TgAEsF5_dZZt3z80W6AEZs-QNv8AwuVl9CsrI/edit?usp=sharing). Each will self define what its own criteria for the following categories:

* Requirements
* Best Practices
* Deployment Standards
* Documentation

These categories will itemize the grading criteria and allow for self-evaluation for each assignment. 

For the Capstone Project there will be a feedback loop of critique and modification between the instructors and student with regards to enhancements needed to be made to a milestone. This feedback is a constructive process and only the final submission will be evaluated against the rubric. 

> Largely this means that you will have the opportunity to correct *most any* mistake prior to penalization. Communicate with your Capstone Team on the platforms provided for ultimate success!

## Communication

# Contact Policy

The entire Capstone Project Team will be available to you throughout the month in addition to any Instructors you would like to request feedback from. Look to your welcome letter for who your primary point of contact will be and the process for requesting feedback from specific Course Directors and Faculty. 

In a team based project communication can create confusion if not organized. To reduce and avoid potential for complications we will be using a [Private Discord Server, which we require you to join](https://bit.ly/WDD_Discord). Please reference your welcome letter in how to get started once logged into the server regarding introductions to your Capstone Team. 

> This will be a primary point of communication and you will be expected to monitor for timely feedback and relevant project information. Please consider installing the related Discord App to your phone and set your notifications for it in a manner that fits your needs. As your role requires, explained deeper in the welcome letter, your interacts with the rest of the team on this communication platform is compulsory.

Please use email ONLY for direct official communication with your Course Director when you need to have a private conversation that is of a sensitive nature or if you are having a major issue that needs direct attention. Questions about assignment clarifications should be done in the course channel so that all instructors are able to provide your requested feedback.

> This usage will not supersede the Full Sail Communication policy regarding the response window, but is structured in this manner to allow for the most rapid response to an issue that may arise and allow for coordination between every member of the Capstone Team assisting you.
