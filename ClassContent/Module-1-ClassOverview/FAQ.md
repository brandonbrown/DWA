# Common Questions

**No Slack?**

Through the capstone courses we will be using Discord to manage the moment to moment communication and coordination. Discord allows for text and voice chat communication and does so better than Slack. This will have faster response times than email and is modeled on professional development firms usage of full featured communication platforms.

**Why so much Documentation?**

In the Capstone Project there are many faculty members and your peers that are invited to review your project. Gaining approval from one faculty member requires informing the entire team.

---

**Do I have to use Github?**

Yes. Your project progress and feedback will heavily utilize the tools offered through Github.

---

**Are Issues User Stories?**


Yes, mostly. There is room to label some issues as a bug or other type that does not specifically require the format of a user story.

**Do I have to deploy this project to a live server?**

Yes. While youâ€™re in DWA, this project will be Continuously Deployed to your live servers for each major milestone. You are responsible for ultimately choosing your technology stack and a host that will adequately support that stack. Discuss with your Course Director free options that could support your tech stack as hosting can become costly.

**Can I change my project during the month?**

Yes, but it will be difficult. Each milestone has a list of prerequisite requirements that must be completed prior to progression. You are able to start over with a new idea, but you will be required to preform all necessary documentation and seek all required approvals. These prerequisites are required and any milestone without ALL completed and approved will be evaluated as a zero.

Changing your project during this month is something that is discouraged against, but is allowed for.

**What if my third-party API becomes unusable?**

Plan for everything, even AWS or Github going down. If your project relies heavily on this third-party API, having a dooms-day plan is critical.
