This grade will account for 10% of your final grade. Your Professionalism grade for this course is based on:

Use of proper online etiquette.
Use of business format for emails to faculty and staff.
Emails that are free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.
Attitude and language in communication with the faculty, staff, and classmates.

The personal investment in your work.
Participation in course activities such as discussions, live meetings when applicable, viewing necessary videos, etc.
Completion of all activities (please be sure that you have clicked on the "I have completed this activity" button for every activity that does not require a submission.)
Professional communication is critical to projecting a professional image and establishing positive professional relationships. All assignments, as well as written and verbal correspondence, should be appropriate for a professional setting in content, tone, and format. Please also note: If a question you are asking has already been answered in previously provided materials, announcements, or emails, you will receive a Professionalism deduction. Make sure you're reading provided materials carefully.

Things to remember throughout your time at Full Sail:

Be respectful in your communication with your instructors and classmates. Email and message correspondence should always begin with a greeting and end with a closing such as "Regards", "Thank you", "Respectfully", etc. Communication on the discussion boards is expected to be conversational and less formal, but still respectful.
Make sure that you are using proper punctuation and capitalization in your correspondence. The following is inappropriate communication: "my activity is locked and reason why?" or "what is this assignment"
You're always welcome to ask questions or bring up concerns about a course, just make sure it's professional and courteous in tone.
Your Professionalism grade starts at 100% with deductions if issues arise.
