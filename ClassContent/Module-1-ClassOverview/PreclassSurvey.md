## Pre-class Survey

Rather than jump into a quiz to prove their abilities, students are offered ten questions that they are asked about interests, how they work, where they would like to work, and so on. The goal is to give the instructor a more human way of opening conversations rather than "you got this wrong let's fix it" being the first experience for incoming students.

### Questions:

1. What are your strongest skills as a developer?
