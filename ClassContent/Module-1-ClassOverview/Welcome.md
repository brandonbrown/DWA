## Welcome to WAI

Let’s build something frightening together. Here’s how this class is going to work:

### Let's make better mistakes tomorrow.

*Mike Monteiro, GOOD magazine, issue 021*

> Let's make better mistakes tomorrow. Let's scratch our heads and give up and wake up and try it again. Let's fail at digging the well the first three times to get it right the fourth. Let's build faster horses, and then strap rocket ships onto them. Let's start a company, let's watch it fail, and then let's start another one.
>
>Let's be the boss. Let's take the boss down. Let's order too much of something just to see where our limits are. Let's take a chance precisely because it might fail. Let's take the hard way out. Let's go to the moon. F--k it; let's go to the moon again. Let's quit our jobs. Let's work at being better at what we do by f--king up faster, not less. Let's f--k up really fast.
>
>Let's wrestle sharks, fight monsters, and disagree with the board. Let's borrow so much money it becomes someone else's problem. Let's start a 10-hour drive by announcing "I'm not that into you anymore." Let's dump everything out of the garage onto the sidewalk and build something really cool in that space. Let's start out to build a better mousetrap, and halfway there let's decide to jump on the mice's team. Let's bet on a longshot. Let's buy her a drink. Let's start baking bread in our cubicle. Let's try bringing fresh water to distant villages precisely because we have no idea how to do it. Let's pool our money. Let's take their money. Let's solve that hard problem. You know that one that keeps you up at night? Let's tackle that bastard. Let it kick our ass a few times, and then finally get it right. Let's find out what's at the bottom of the ocean. Let's tame the Kraken. Let's just fucking tell people we've read Infinite Jest and move on. Let's forgive our parents. Let's do something with the goddamned planet. Let's rent an electric generator and open a food cart that sells nothing but frosted PopTarts, but makes a lot of fucking noise. Let's have a breakthrough. Let's have a breakdown. Let's agree that bruises fade, bones heal, hearts mend, and that tomorrow we're right back on that horse and that this time, THIS TIME! we've at least got a rocket strapped to its back.

Welcome to Web Application Integrations! Here in WAI we’ll be working together to build applications far too big for a single month. So you’ll instead have three! Work done here in WAI will carry forward into your next classes, Deployment of Web Applications and Project and Portfolio VII.

We’re going to cover a lot in this class. Some will be new, much of it should be review, you’ll be pushing the boundaries of your interests, and your instructors will help to reinforce the areas you may need practice with.

As part of WAI, you’ll be required to seek out critique, feedback, and direction from more than your primary instructor. All of your past learning experiences will be put to work throughout the remainder of your time as a student. This will require you to seek out the experts in the tools, techniques, and challenges that will arise through this time. As part of this arrangement, your primary instructor will be seeking input and review from these same experts. Grading in this class will be collaborative to ensure a high-quality of work is created.

The work you will perform in this class will primarily be a self-directed and instructor guided project. From concept to delivery, the responsibility falls upon you to communicate your progress, plan your tasks, and hold yourself and your peers accountable for following through on expectations.

Myself and everyone at Full Sail are excited to see you enter this last phase of your time with us before graduation. Let's strap on those rockets and get this thing moving!
