# Welcome to DWA!

Hello and welcome to Deployment of Web Projects! I will be your Primary Course Director! I would like to invite you to the Chat Platform that a majority of our communication will occur within this month. 

> You can Join our private Discord Server with the link [http://bit.ly/WDD_Discord](http://bit.ly/WDD_Discord)

Discord is very similar to Slack, but has a few significant improvements including integrated voice and screen-sharing, in addition to not having any of the message limit restrictions that Slack does.

Please use [the link](http://bit.ly/WDD_Discord) to join, create an account, and hop into the conversation, just send a notification to the `@Professors` in the general channel for access to the `capstone-project` channel!

## Empathy in Team Communication

Before we kick-off this month's content I'd like to explore a few topics of Empathy and Understanding as it relates to your journey.

[![How Software Dies](https://img.youtube.com/vi/J9OpTNk0hYc/0.jpg)](http://bit.ly/DWA_Welcome)

In the [video above](http://bit.ly/DWA_Welcome), MPJ, a former Spotify Developer (current during the video), discusses how psychological safety is critical to successful teams.

Google conducted a two-year study on team performance and they have found psychological safety to be the most important factor when identifying successful teams. Team members need to feel safe in making mistakes and not being ridiculed or thought of as incompetent. 

Psychological safety, beyond anything else, is something I hope we can foster within this class!

This month is going to push you beyond your perceived limits, everyone, at some point will need help. You are building the most complex application you have made yet! There are unknown components that you will have to dream up and then create to solve a problem you only have a vague idea about...  Don't feel that you are alone when you are lost and feeling filled with despair. This will happen. It is part of the natural evolution of a developer.

## This All Is Rather Hard Work

[Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) is a great blog article that explores. Here's an excerpt from that article that sums up four early stages of learning to code.

> 1. **The Hand Holding Honeymoon** is the joy-filled romp through highly polished resources teaching you things that seem tricky but are totally do-able with their intensive support. You will primarily learn basic syntax but feel great about your accomplishments.

> 2. **The Cliff of Confusion** is the painful realization that it's a lot harder when the hand-holding ends and it feels like you can't actually do anything on your own yet. Your primary challenges are constant debugging and not quite knowing how to ask the right questions as you fight your way towards any kind of momentum.

> 3. **The Desert of Despair** is the long and lonely journey through a pathless landscape where every new direction seems correct but you're frequently going in circles and you're starving for the resources to get you through it. Beware the "Mirages of Mania", like sirens of the desert, which will lead you astray.

> 4. **The Upswing of Awesome** is when you've finally found a path through the desert and pulled together an understanding of how to build applications. But your code is still siloed and brittle like a house of cards. You gain confidence because your sites appear to run, you've mastered a few useful patterns, and your friends think your interfaces are cool but you're terrified to look under the hood and you ultimately don't know how to get to "production ready" code. How do you bridge the gap to a real job?

## Pulling it all together

I bring up psychological safety and identify that coding is rather hard because we are about to embark on a LOT of communication. Communication between you, your primary instructor, lab assistants, and various other members of the Capstone Project Team.

This is a safe environment. No stupid questions and if something needs clarified, it's fully okay to ask! Think you found an error somewhere or something that contradicts some other response you've gotten, point it out and let's all work through it together!

The main caveat is that we need these clarifications, questions, and call-outs to happen in front of the entire team, not in a direct message to just one team member. Even the most simple of questions need to occur in a place your entire team can see and respond.

These team channels are a safe-harbor for you to make mistakes without lasting consequences. Many lessons can be learned here without having to fear reprisals or stigmas from your team members. We are all here to help, including your peers.

## The Nuts and Bolts of This Month

Communication is going to be absolutely critical this month. We are going to be working together on your Capstone Project to bring it from an MVP to a Public Release ready candidate. This is going to require immense amounts of conversations, feedback, and documenting it all is going to be complex.

To minimize the complexity, or rather to simplify the complexity we are going to have the following active points of communication.

* [Discord]((http://bit.ly/WDD_Discord))
* Github
* Email

Please configure your notification settings appropriately as you will be actively engaged across multiple platforms.  We will consolidate the communication as best as possible, but please engage and respond to any requests on the platform preforming the notification. 

Additionally, please direct any correspondence directly at your intended target.

**Example**: You are notified by email, due to your github settings, of a question asked of you, on an issue posted to Github.

> **Good Response**: You respond to the question, on the specific issue, on Github, *tagging (@userName) the originator of the question*.

> **Bad Response**: You respond to the question, on the specific issue, on Github.

> **Bad Response**:  You respond in Discord with a direct message to the Capstone Team Member asking the question.
