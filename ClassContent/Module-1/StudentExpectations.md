## Student Expectations

As a student in WAI, you are expected to consistently Learn, Wonder, Create, Fail, Thrive, and to Show Up.

###Learn  
Above everything else, a habit of continual and meaningful learning is the most useful trait of every Full Sail graduate. In Web Application Integrations, you are expected to reinforce this learning habit with a driving, burning passion.

###Wonder  
Balancing productivity with finding a beautiful solution is a trait sought after in every professional. Give yourself enough time to explore and grow in areas you have yet to focus in. Doing what others have done will always keep you a step behind. Wonder, explore, push the limits, never settle for the status quo.

###Create  
Put your mind and your hands to your work. Procrastinating in this class doesn't hurt your instructors and working for the grade doesn't guarantee personal satisfaction. Put your entire being into this work and you'll create more than you thought possible.

###Fail  
It's okay to fail. You should fail more. You should fail fast. The faster you fail, the sooner your success will find its way to you. Don't be afraid to take chances while you're here working with us. Your instructors are going to be hyper-critical of your work. We are going to push you to create work beyond what you think is currently possible. We are doing this because we care deeply about each and every student who comes through Full Sail, and want you to succeed beyond your wildest financial dreams and thoughts of pure fulfillment. These are not personal attacks, these are not driven by ulterior-motives. If you find yourself failing, its because the instructors you've trusted to guide you are trying to help you.

###Thrive  
Take time to appreciate how far you've come and where you're heading. Be sure to step away from the code, the pixels, the pressure of this project. Avoiding burnout and living a happy, fulfilling, and joyous life outside of your work is key to your long term career success. Your instructors are here to help you in this area as well with advice, lessons, and even a few stories. If you feel the pressure of the project weighing on you, talk to your instructors, they will help.

###Show Up  
This is not the place for you to start slacking. This is not the time for you to go on cruise-control. We will hold you to the highest standards of professionalism in these remaining classes. We expect you to show up in mind, body, and spirit every day for every task. Come to lectures with a positive mindset, show up to labs with laser focus, and spend your time outside of the classroom in meaningful, cultivating, and energizing ways.
