## Standups

Communication is the backbone of any successful team, business, or partnership. It is the sign of a true professional to handle communication clearly and proactively, leaving nothing to uncertainty or unclear.

This assignment is where all official communication concerning your project will be handled. This discussion requires 2 submissions each week. One update for your week's plans and a second for your week's accomplishments.

The required two updates each week are designed to mimic best practices found in the industry: Monday or Tuesday - Plans for the week. Thursday or Friday - How the week has gone, both the good and the bad, and what you have learned.
