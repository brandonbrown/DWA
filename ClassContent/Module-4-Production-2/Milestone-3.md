## Milestone 3: Production Core

How did your first week of production go? This week is your first chance to dedicate all of your time to the construction of your application. Use it wisely! Time management, focus, and honest self-critique are the skills you'll need to rely on heavily to adhere to your plan and overcome any challenges that arise at this point. Keep moving forward, don't get hung up in details, and don't open the door for doubt as it will only slow you down.

### Milestone Deliverables

1. Modified Design Artifacts
2. Milestone-3 Pull Request
3. Continued Research
4. Code Archive
5. Stand Ups

### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Modified Design Artifacts

Over the course of discovery, you've been testing, interviewing, and presenting concepts to potential users. Your design assumptions should have shifted to understandings and your design artifacts should reflect this. Please update any documentation, links, or files containing design examples that have been shared with your instructors.

#### 2. Milestone-3 Pull Request

At each major milestone, any work done through GitHub will be delivered as a Pull Request. This Pull Request may be accepted or rejected by any instructor involved with the management of your project. A rejected Pull Request that is not corrected before the Sunday night deadline will incur a late penalty. Be sure to plan enough time for instructors to review your work.

*Instructors may submit review of your Pull Request after the deadline if not allocated enough time before. A Pull Request submitted before the deadline and approved after will not incur the late penalty. However, a submission close to the deadline does not shift responsibility to the instructor.*

#### 3. Continued Research

You will be expected to show continued thorough research into your concept application(s). This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 4. Code Archive

Along with a Pull Request, an archive of all artifacts created during the week must be submitted to FSO. This archive is expected by Sunday night at 11:59pm.

Artifacts that should be included are:

1. Full code-base snapshot
2. Database Dumps
3. Links to any third party management system: Github, Trello, InvisionApp, etc.
4. Non-production design files. Do not submit .psd, .ai, .xd, etc.
5. New documentation or files submitted to instructors
6. Other important, project shaping files or assets

#### 5. Stand Ups

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the week ahead. Your stand up should reflect progress and include an updated link to your project management solution described in Module 1. Your end of week post will reflect on the progress you've made, both positive and negative, and honestly describe accomplishments and setbacks.
