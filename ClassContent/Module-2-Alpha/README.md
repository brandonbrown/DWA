# DWA Module 2: Pivot

The refinement of the project spec will be the primary concern for this milestone. At this time Students have conceived of an idea, roughly spec'd it, built an MVP, and have received significant critical feedback. Now is the time to utilize that feedback to refine the project spec and build out the proper project plan.

This plan will be the final plan of attack for completion and release of the Capstone Application. Students will be seeking approval of this spec which will come in two forms. 

* Preliminary Approval, which allows the student to begin working on the next milestone.
* Final Approval after an exhaustive review of the Project Spec. Revisions or clarifications may be requested of the student during this review prior to Final Approval.

> Milestone Deliverables:
>  * [ ] Refined Project Spec
>  * [ ] Velocity Check
