### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Content Detail

#### 3. Continued Research

You will be expected to show active and thorough research into your concept application(s). This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 7. Stand Ups

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the week ahead. You may still be in the Discovery Phase, or you may be ready to move into Producion. Your stand up should reflect this progress and include an updated link to your project management solution described in Module 1. Your end of week post will reflect on the progress you've made, both positive and negative, and honestly describe accomplishments and setbacks.
