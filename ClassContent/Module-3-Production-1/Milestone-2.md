### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Final Specifications Document

**Application production will not begin until this document is finalized and approved.**  

The absolute last moment this document will be accepted is Wednesday night at 11:59PM. Failure to meet this deadline will incur drastic consequences to your project expectations as well as your overall class grade. Do not miss this deadline. Early submissions are encouraged.

#### 2. Kickoff Video Presentation

Every project needs to start down the right path with a great sense of positive energy. To accomplish this, you will create a kick-off video presentation that summarizes your concept as a concrete set of expectations. The content of this video should not create more questions but show that you've done your work to eliminate blind-spots with the help of the experienced faculty. This video will be shared with faculty Friday afternoon, requiring you to have it completed by Thursday evening. In about 5 to 7 minutes, to the best of your abilities describe the following:

1. Introduction: Who you are and your application's elevator pitch.
2. Concerns and challenges that were uncovered through the Discovery Phase
3. Your response to these concerns and challenges
4. A high-level explanation of production plans
5. Summary of your application and key reminders

Remember, this is to communicate your concept has evolved into a concrete plan to professionals in your network. This video should instill confidence and provide reassurance that you are the right person or team to build this project.


#### 3. Modified Design Artifacts

Over the course of discovery, you've been testing, interviewing, and presenting concepts to potential users. Your design assumptions should have shifted to understandings and your design artifacts should reflect this. Please update any documentation, links, or files containing design examples that have been shared with your instructors.

#### 4. Continued Research

You will be expected to show continued thorough research into your concept application(s). This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 5. Milestone-2 Pull Request

At each major milestone, any work done through GitHub will be delivered as a Pull Request. This Pull Request may be accepted or rejected by any instructor involved with the management of your project. A rejected Pull Request that is not corrected before the Sunday night deadline will incur a late penalty. Be sure to plan enough time for instructors to review your work.

*Instructors may submit review of your Pull Request after the deadline if not allocated enough time before. A Pull Request submitted before the deadline and approved after will not incur the late penalty. However, a submission close to the deadline does not shift responsibility to the instructor.*

#### 6. Code Archive

Along with a Pull Request, an archive of all artifacts created during the week must be submitted to FSO. This archive is expected by Sunday night at 11:59pm.

Artifacts that should be included are:

1. Full code-base snapshot
2. Database Dumps
3. Links to any third party management system: Github, Trello, InvisionApp, etc.
4. Non-production design files. Do not submit .psd, .ai, .xd, etc.
5. New documentation or files submitted to instructors
6. Other important, project shaping files or assets

#### 7. Stand Ups

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the week ahead. You may still be in the Discovery Phase, or you may be ready to move into Producion. Your stand up should reflect this progress and include an updated link to your project management solution described in Module 1. Your end of week post will reflect on the progress you've made, both positive and negative, and honestly describe accomplishments and setbacks.
