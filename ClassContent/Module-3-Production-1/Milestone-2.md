### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Final Specifications Document

**Application production will not begin until this document is finalized and approved.**  

The absolute last moment this document will be accepted is Wednesday night at 11:59PM. Failure to meet this deadline will incur drastic consequences to your project expectations as well as your overall class grade. Do not miss this deadline. Early submissions are encouraged.

#### 2. Kickoff Video Presentation

Every project needs to start down the right path with a great sense of positive energy. To accomplish this, you will create a kick-off video presentation that summarizes your concept as a concrete set of expectations. The content of this video should not create more questions but show that you've done your work to eliminate blind-spots with the help of the experienced faculty. This video will be shared with faculty Friday afternoon, requiring you to have it completed by Thursday evening. In about 5 to 7 minutes, to the best of your abilities describe the following:

1. Introduction: Who you are and your application's elevator pitch.
2. Concerns and challenges that were uncovered through the Discovery Phase
3. Your response to these concerns and challenges
4. A high-level explanation of production plans
5. Summary of your application and key reminders

Remember, this is to communicate your concept has evolved into a concrete plan to professionals in your network. This video should instill confidence and provide reassurance that you are the right person or team to build this project.

#### 3. Continued Research

You will be expected to show active and thorough research into your concept application(s). This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 7. Stand Ups

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the week ahead. You may still be in the Discovery Phase, or you may be ready to move into Producion. Your stand up should reflect this progress and include an updated link to your project management solution described in Module 1. Your end of week post will reflect on the progress you've made, both positive and negative, and honestly describe accomplishments and setbacks.
