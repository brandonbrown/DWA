## [What is DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg) (7m video)
DevOps and Full Stack development require application developers to venture into the operations side of an application and build out infrastructure. Docker is one advanced example solution to the devOps infrastructure question of how can you mirror development and production environments effectively and efficiently. This video is a breakdown of why this move is being made by many companies.

## [A Case for Docker / Docker Demystified]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGYAg7TMmp0) (8m video)
This is a touch of research that will explain how docker solves some potential problems for us.

## [Optional] [Docker Basics](https://www.lynda.com/Docker-tutorials/What-Docker/485649/514164-4.html?org=fullsail.edu) (2hr Lynda)
Docker... is a big deal. Full Sail has an entire degree dedicated to Cloud Networking and building containers and the like. We are condensing all of that into a small conversation for this month. You can optionally use Docker for your Capstone Project. It would be a large undertaking to build out a Docker environment for your application, but it would also be very robust. Consider Docker for your infrastructure.

## [Micro Services Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKL3fV5UR8w) (3m video)
Your application can be broken down into microservices, should you want to go that route. Here is some information to get you started on that path.

## [Scaling Node Applications](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-node-js-applications-8492bd8afadc) (20m read)
Time to talk about some really complex ideas when it comes to how our applications will work. Microservices routinely are replicated, clustered, and load balanced and stress testing our applications... but what does that all mean and how do we do it? This article walks through these concepts. While you do not need to be intimately familiar with how all of this works regarding scaling application services, you at least need to understand at a higher level how applications (Node as well as any other language) are written to deal with a high volume of usage.
