## Research

Each week you are expected to constructively contribute to research based discussion. Research submissions must be substantial with sources and cite material referenced. This is not the place for posts such as "I thought this was cool [link]." Research must be performed with purpose and need to be meaningful to your project or growth as a professional. Most research should impact your project, but it is understood that it is not a practical request to see all research impact on your project.

Research performed on a peer's project is acceptable for this discussion only after sharing research performed for your own needs. Research based on your peers' projects is encouraged, but will be painstakingly reviewed for proper professional tone and communication.

Show active and thorough research into your application. This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support. A few examples of research topics and prompts below:

1. Identify Target market
2. Learn competitor strategies and products
3. Challenge any assumption
4. Creating Personas
5. Research Case Studies and White Papers
6. Search social media
7. Solve one problem at a time

### Discussion Guidelines

By Thursday night at 11:59pm, you must make an initial post containing your research, its prompt, and any sources you used in the formulation of your findings.

You must respond meaningfully to a peer's research by end of the week. Acceptable responses will ask questions, offer support, and even challenge findings with other research.

Your instructor will be taking part in this research discussion and actively looking to find information countering your findings. This is not a personal attack nor necessarily your instructor's viewpoints, but meant to help you practice defending a researched position.
