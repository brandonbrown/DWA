#### 6. Stand Up and Post-Mortem

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the final week ahead. This update should give an honest assessment of expectations for your final deliverable. Will you be delivering in full, beyond expectations, or is there a chance features will be dropped to ensure a core product is delivered? Your final post in this class will be a Post-mortem. We will look back at the work you've done, how the project came together, and most importantly what you've learned through this experience.
