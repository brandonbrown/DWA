## Milestone 4: Minimum Viable Product

It's all about to wrap up, are you ready or is it time for the after-burners to kick in? If all goes to plan, the second half of this week will be dedicated to the creation of assets that will provide a clear example of your project's current status. This will include video, more documentation, and a chance to reflect on your project with your peers, instructor, and other stake-holders.

As you reach this stage, you may be feeling a bit of panic that you haven't done enough. Remember, the goal is a minimum viable product. We don't need all the bells-and-whistes, we don't need it to look perfect, we can even allow for a few known bugs to exist. If you reach this stage and can use what you've built to explain your entire application, you can count it as a success. It has taken a lot of work to get here, and you'll need to put more in to take it to the next release stage. This week will prepare you and your application for this transition by ensuring documentation is updated, code is managed, project management tools are accurate, and that you have truly pushed your project the furthest it could reach.

### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Video Presentation of MVP

It's time for you to show off! You've put in a time-shifting amount of work this month, let the stake-holders know that their confidence in you should be stronger than ever. This video should also be made with a thought to the future. As you've been creating videos for this class, you've documented your progress in an easy to digest, visual and audio manner that can be shared with potential employers- maybe investors! This video is key to this process- show what you were able to do as it reflects your original planning and scope. Employers, investors, and stake-holders want to know you can be trusted to reach the goals you set out to hit. In about 3 to 5 minutes, you should discuss the following points:

1. Introduction: Who you are and your application's elevator pitch.
2. Demonstrate how your application solves a problem with its main functionality
2. Demonstrate secondary key functionality
3. Discuss where you exceeded or missed expectations
4. Discuss how and why you will adjust remaining scope
5. Summary of your application and key reminders

#### 7. Stand Ups and Post Mortem

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the final week ahead. This update should give an honest assessment of expectations for your final deliverable. Will you be delivering in full, beyond expectations, or is there a chance features will be dropped to ensure a core product is delivered? Your final post in this class will be a Post-mortem. We will look back at the work you've done, how the project came together, and most importantly what you've learned through this experience.
