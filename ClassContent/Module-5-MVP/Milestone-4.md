## Milestone 4: Minimum Viable Product

It's all about to wrap up, are you ready or is it time for the after-burners to kick in? If all goes to plan, the second half of this week will be dedicated to the creation of assets that will provide a clear example of your project's current status. This will include video, more documentation, and a chance to reflect on your project with your peers, instructor, and other stake-holders.

As you reach this stage, you may be feeling a bit of panic that you haven't done enough. Remember, the goal is a minimum viable product. We don't need all the bells-and-whistes, we don't need it to look perfect, we can even allow for a few known bugs to exist. If you reach this stage and can use what you've built to explain your entire application, you can count it as a success. It has taken a lot of work to get here, and you'll need to put more in to take it to the next release stage. This week will prepare you and your application for this transition by ensuring documentation is updated, code is managed, project management tools are accurate, and that you have truly pushed your project the furthest it could reach.

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the final week ahead. This update should give an honest assessment of expectations for your final deliverable. Will you be delivering in full, beyond expectations, or is there a chance features will be dropped to ensure a core product is delivered? Your final post in this class will be a Post-mortem. We will look back at the work you've done, how the project came together, and most importantly what you've learned through this experience.
