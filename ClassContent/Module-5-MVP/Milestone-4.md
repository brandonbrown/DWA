## Milestone 4: Minimum Viable Product

It's all about to wrap up, are you ready or is it time for the after-burners to kick in? If all goes to plan, the second half of this week will be dedicated to the creation of assets that will provide a clear example of your project's current status. This will include video, more documentation, and a chance to reflect on your project with your peers, instructor, and other stake-holders.

As you reach this stage, you may be feeling a bit of panic that you haven't done enough. Remember, the goal is a minimum viable product. We don't need all the bells-and-whistes, we don't need it to look perfect, we can even allow for a few known bugs to exist. If you reach this stage and can use what you've built to explain your entire application, you can count it as a success. It has taken a lot of work to get here, and you'll need to put more in to take it to the next release stage. This week will prepare you and your application for this transition by ensuring documentation is updated, code is managed, project management tools are accurate, and that you have truly pushed your project the furthest it could reach.

### Milestone Deliverable Details

#### 1. Video Presentation of MVP

It's time for you to show off! You've put in a time-shifting amount of work this month, let the stake-holders know that their confidence in you should be stronger than ever. This video should also be made with a thought to the future. As you've been creating videos for this class, you've documented your progress in an easy to digest, visual and audio manner that can be shared with potential employers- maybe investors! This video is key to this process- show what you were able to do as it reflects your original planning and scope. Employers, investors, and stake-holders want to know you can be trusted to reach the goals you set out to hit. In about 3 to 5 minutes, you should discuss the following points:

1. Introduction: Who you are and your application's elevator pitch.
2. Demonstrate how your application solves a problem with its main functionality
2. Demonstrate secondary key functionality
3. Discuss where you exceeded or missed expectations
4. Discuss how and why you will adjust remaining scope
5. Summary of your application and key reminders

#### 2. Handoff Documentation

As you progress into the next class you'll have a new primary instructor overseeing this project. You'll want to ensure this transition happens smoothly, and a small handoff will do just that. This document will share links to key project information such as your code repository, project management tools, research archive, code documentation, and anything else produced that will help to clarify your overall project, its current state, and its trajectory towards deployment.

#### 3. Modified Design Artifacts

Over the course of production you've been able to interact with your designs and have likely found places that require change. Please update any documentation, links, or files containing design examples that have been shared with your instructors to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion of mismatched design visuals.

#### 4. Continued Research

You will be expected to show continued thorough research into your application. This can be in the form of target market research, competitive analysis, technology possibilities, and more. This research will be documented through a discussion activity which your instructor will challenge assumptions and claims made without properly researched support.

#### 5. Milestone-4 Pull Request

At each major milestone, any work done through GitHub will be delivered as a Pull Request. This Pull Request may be accepted or rejected by any instructor involved with the management of your project. A rejected Pull Request that is not corrected before the Sunday night deadline will incur a late penalty. Be sure to plan enough time for instructors to review your work.

*Instructors may submit review of your Pull Request after the deadline if not allocated enough time before. A Pull Request submitted before the deadline and approved after will not incur the late penalty. However, a submission close to the deadline does not shift responsibility to the instructor.*

#### 6. Code Archive

Along with a Pull Request, an archive of all artifacts created during the week must be submitted to FSO. This archive is expected by Sunday night at 11:59pm.

Artifacts that should be included are:

1. Full code-base snapshot
2. Database Dumps
3. Links to any third party management system: Github, Trello, InvisionApp, etc.
4. Non-production design files. Do not submit .psd, .ai, .xd, etc.
5. New documentation or files submitted to instructors
6. Other important, project shaping files or assets

#### 7. Stand Ups and Post Mortem

Each week you are expected to deliver a series of stand up posts to FSO. This week, your initial post will describe your plans for the final week ahead. This update should give an honest assessment of expectations for your final deliverable. Will you be delivering in full, beyond expectations, or is there a chance features will be dropped to ensure a core product is delivered? Your final post in this class will be a Post-mortem. We will look back at the work you've done, how the project came together, and most importantly what you've learned through this experience.
