## Standup and Post-Mortem

Consistent and honest communication is an easy method of leaving a highly-positive experience for your clients, coworkers, and professional connections to reflect on. As a project moves beyond a large milestone, or even comes to completion, you must take advantage of this moment and leave one more meaningful impression behind.

After this month, you know that things do not always go as planned. Even if you finished on-time and accomplished every goal, there’s a good chance you can still find better ways to manage your project. The best way to assess your work is to conduct a post-mortem meeting, also called a retrospective meeting for those of you who get a certain feeling when you hear the word “post-mortem”. A post-mortem meeting is a team gathering that takes place at the end of a project where the group examines the challenges and successes of the endeavor.

Holding a post-mortem is common across many industries. They help you and your team in many ways:

- Gain efficiency: You’ll uncover better ways to approach tasks and projects.
- Increase morale: Talking out problems and celebrating wins will bring your team closer together and get them excited about their next project.
- Work better together: By listening to many perspectives, your team will become more empathetic to the way they all work.
- Learn from mistakes: It’s a time to inspect what went wrong and find better ways to approach projects moving forward.
- Provide closure: This meeting can be a single step in officially closing the books on projects.
- Share information internally: If you share the meeting outcomes with the rest of your organization, you will help inform better practices and create a valuable dialogue about how you work within your organization (not just with your team).
- Celebrate the successes: It’s not just a meeting set up to talk about the negative things.
